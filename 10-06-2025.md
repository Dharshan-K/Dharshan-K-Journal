Commit Hash: f2626fe01df2937f852d35ad2b9c1089976319f8

Commit Message: The API is dockerized.

This commit dockerizes the Farmako Coupon API.  The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files were added, along with significant updates to the README.md to reflect the dockerized nature of the project. The README now also includes a detailed database schema design document, explaining the design rationale and including a UML diagram (uml.svg).

It uses enums to improve readability and type safety.

Additionally, Swagger documentation was integrated for easier API exploration using docs/docs.go, docs/swagger.json, and docs/swagger.yaml. The docker-compose file was updated to provide a more robust setup with better container management.
