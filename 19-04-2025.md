Commit: Updated mongoDB update.

Commit Hash: 9092e4d2bcf5ddb260e40eee286257f60dc98853

Files Changed:

JournalFrontend/src/Components/journalEditor.jsx: This file was entirely removed.  It appears this component, a React Markdown editor for journal entries, was completely replaced or refactored into a different approach.  Further investigation is required to understand the new implementation.
JournalFrontend/src/Components/journalSpec.jsx: This file was also entirely removed. This component likely handled journal specifications and the initial setup of journal creation. The removal suggests a potential redesign of the user interface and workflow.
app.py: This commit updated the commitJournal function and the constructIndex function in the backend to correct a key name inconsistency. The key "username" was changed to "userName" to match the frontend. This fixes a bug where the user's last updated timestamp wasn't being updated correctly in the MongoDB database after a journal entry was saved.

Summary: This commit involved significant changes to the frontend and a small but important fix to the backend. The frontend components responsible for journal entry editing and specifications were removed, indicating a potential major restructuring of this part of the application.  The backend change resolves a data consistency issue related to updating the user's last updated timestamp.  Further investigation is needed to determine the full scope of the frontend refactor.
